# Personal Task Manager

**Project Code:** WST21-PM-2026-SF
**Student Name:** Gabutero, Glydelle V.
**Course & Year:** BSIT-2
**Database Used:** SQLite

## Features
- Add Task
- View Tasks
- Edit Task
- Delete Task
- Update Status

## Technologies Used
- Laravel
- Routes
- Controller
- Model
- Blade Views
- SQLite Database

## How It Works
1. Route (`routes/web.php`) receives the request and sends it to the TaskController.
2. Controller (`TaskController.php`) handles the logic — fetching, creating, updating, and deleting tasks.
3. Model (`Task.php`) connects to the `tasks` table in the database.
4. Blade Views (`resources/views/tasks/`) display the task list, add form, and edit form to the user.
